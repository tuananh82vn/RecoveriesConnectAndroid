{"Name":"Android Support Library v8 Renderscript","Id":3316,"Alias":"xamandroidsupportv8","Description":"# v8 RenderScript Android Support Library\n\nThis library adds support for the RenderScript computation framework.\n\n\n\n## Android Support Libraries\n\nThe Android Support Libraries are a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. This design means that your applications can use the libraries\u0027 features and still be compatible with devices running older versions of Android.\n\nIncluding the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered a best practice for application developers, depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users. \n\n\n","Version":"25.1.1.0","Summary":"Provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.","QuickStart":"This library adds support for the RenderScript computation framework.\n\nRenderScript is a framework for running computationally intensive tasks at high performance on Android. RenderScript is primarily oriented for use with data-parallel computation, although serial computationally intensive workloads can benefit as well. The RenderScript runtime will parallelize work across all processors available on a device, such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, or DSPs, allowing you to focus on expressing algorithms rather than scheduling work or load balancing. RenderScript is especially useful for applications performing image processing, computational photography, or computer vision.\n\nThe renderscript library won\u0027t run on armv6 (armeabi), so make sure that you are only supporting either armeabi-v7a, mips or x86.\n\nThere are several APIs included in this library.
